NumPy - all array operations, matrix construction, numerical calculations

Building the Hamiltonian matrix
Vectorized spectral generation (fast - no loops)
Strain field calculations

SciPy - specialized numerical algorithms

scipy.linalg.eigh: Eigenvalue decomposition of Hermitian matrices (optimized for symmetric matrices, faster than generic eigensolvers)
scipy.signal.find_peaks: Could be used for peak detection (though I generate spectra directly)
Linear algebra utilities

Matplotlib - visualization

All 12 panels in the comprehensive plot
3D surface plots for waterfall visualization
Extensive customization (colormaps, labels, layouts)

Why these choices:
These are the standard scientific Python stack - widely used, well-documented, and performant. The eigenvalue decomposition is the computational bottleneck, but scipy.linalg.eigh uses LAPACK under the hood, so it's essentially C/Fortran performance. For a 3×3 matrix, it's nearly instantaneous.

Object-Oriented Design (this is important)

1. MaterialProperties dataclass

Encapsulates: thickness, Young's modulus, Poisson ratio, density
Why separate: You can define multiple materials and compare them
Benefit: Change one line to test a different polymer

2. IRBandProperties dataclass

Encapsulates: center frequency, intensity, linewidth, mechanochromic coefficients, transition dipole moment
Why separate: Each vibrational mode is an independent entity
Benefit: Add a fourth mode? Just append another IRBandProperties object

3. CouplingParameters dataclass

Encapsulates: which modes couple, coupling strength, coupling type, stress modulation
Why separate: Coupling is a relationship between modes, not a property of modes
Benefit: Turn off TDC? Just delete that coupling parameter. Test weak vs strong coupling? Change one number.

4. TensileTester class

Handles: Strain application, stress calculation, local strain fields
Why separate: Mechanical testing is independent of spectroscopy
Benefit: Could swap in non-linear mechanics, viscoelasticity, or plasticity without touching spectroscopy code

5. CoupledVibrationalSystem class

Handles: Hamiltonian construction, diagonalization, intensity calculations, coupling physics
This is the quantum mechanics engine
Why separate: All the coupling logic is isolated here
Benefit: Want to add anharmonic terms? Modify only this class.

6. TransientIRSpectroscopy class

Handles: Spectrum generation, lineshapes (Voigt profiles), baseline/noise
Why separate: Spectroscopy concerns (lineshapes, resolution) are independent of coupling
Benefit: Swap Voigt for Gaussian? Change noise level? All contained here.

7. TandemTensileIRExperiment class

Orchestrates everything: combines mechanical testing, coupling system, and spectroscopy
Runs the experiment loop
Generates all visualizations
Why separate: High-level experiment control doesn't clutter the physics classes
